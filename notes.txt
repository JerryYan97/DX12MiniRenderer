Lights, shadowing, real-time HW Raytracing.
GLTF, OpenUSD loading.


Design Goal:
Muti-Renderer Backends -- Forward+, HW-RT, Deferred...
Muti-Format Model load -- GLTF, OpenUSD.
Simple ImGUI based loading logic. (It's just to show that I know this API and if I want to show that I have DCC experience, I should just investigate Blender.)


Forward(I don't feel like that I should use the Forward because it cannot work when there are too much lights.), Forward+, Deferred Rendering: https://www.3dgep.com/forward-plus/

- Integrate DX12 memory allocator.
