Lights, shadowing, real-time HW Raytracing.
GLTF, OpenUSD loading.


Design Goal:
Muti-Renderer Backends -- Forward+, HW-RT, Deferred...
Muti-Format Model load -- GLTF, OpenUSD.
Simple ImGUI based loading logic. (It's just to show that I know this API and if I want to show that I have DCC experience, I should just investigate Blender.)
Images Dump. Camera Movement with Animation Dump.

Static Scene Switching, Loading and Rendering Feature. No Level Manipulation. Maybe good to have 

Forward(I don't feel like that I should use the Forward because it cannot work when there are too much lights.), Forward+, Deferred Rendering: https://www.3dgep.com/forward-plus/

Some graphics technique experiments -- Raytracing, Hair Rendering, Volumetric Rendering, Real-time Physics...

We can do the abstraction along the way instead of spending too much time on the software architecture.

Note that I was always using the coupled swapchain-FrameContext structure for simplicity. It is equivalent that we only have two buffers in the swapchain instead of 3, which can be harmful for the performance.

[RT RoadMap needs to be put aside because of bugs -- Need to untangle the DXR example little by little. Won't be released.]
Milestone 0:
- Integrate YamlCpp (Done)
- Setup Yaml + GLTF based scene structure. (Done)
- Render out a Triangle/Basic GLTF model in no bounce RT. (Load from fixed path)
- Integrate DX12 memory allocator. (NO Need)
- Simple ImGUI Layout -- Overlay ImGUI window, Scene Hierarchy (Print on Load). (No Need)

Milestone 1:
- Make a cornell box (GLTF) in Blender.
- Integrate Input Handler, which reuses the Vulkan project's input handler.
- Cornell box GLTF Render with no bounce RT.

Milestone 2:
- Cornell box fully work path tracer rendering.

Milestone 3+:
- Sponza/Nv unreal Restir scene rendering.
- FSR integration.
- Refactorization...
- Better GUI
- Volumetric Rendering...
- Hair Rendering...


[Forward RoadMap]
Milestone 0: (Done)
Fixed Triangle (Checked)

Milestone 1:
GLTF Triangle, Cube, Sphere. (Done)
Basic Camera Model. (Done)
Shader Load Infra (Using DXC API -- NO Need) 
Basic Point Light Spheres Scene -- PBR.
-------
Specific Milestone 1 tasks:
- Shader Prebuild infra setup -- PBR shader is relatively large -- Download DXC and put it as a prebuild step.
- Model and Materials RAM and DRAM Asset Manager: Only keep one copy, default materials assign
- PBR Shader migration.
- Spheres' basic rendering
- Point lights yaml setup.
- Normal Map Integration (Possible migrate to all other vulkan examples. No Need. We will assume standard model without scaling)
-------


Milestone 2:
Texture Cube --> Texture GLTF Models.
GLTF Texture PBR basic support.
More GLTF models rendering (Simple) --> Decorate project front page.
Code Cleanup.


Milestone 3:
Integrate IBL, Cubemap Background Rendering.


Misc TODOs:
- Use singlenton, global variables and static to simplify programming patterns.
- DXR, DLSS/FSR, mesh-shader Nanite, Restir, GPU-Workgraph examples are must for my further graphics career.

Gallery Candidants -- Texture or no texture complicated objects:
Avocado, BarramundiFish, Buggy(It needs too much self-shadow, so we give it up. Though we should support it sometime), Duck (Done), Fox,
